Mathematically, the potentially infinte set of samples has been multiplied by a rectangular sampling function, or *windowed* by the rectangular function.  Unfortunately, because of the duality relationship between multiplication in the time domain and convolution in the frequency domain, as we will see, the resulting transform is affected by *leakage*."

In the example above, the input has a period of $\\frac{N}{2}$, so when we compute an $N$ point DFT, then we find that its frequency lies exactly on the 2nd sample in the frequency domain.  It turns out that in this case, for $N=128$, the only non-zero samples are those at $\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{32}$.

The DTFT shape is very similar to the one above (remember the signal has changed, but only by altering its frequency slightly).

    "It might be thought that the way to solve this problem is to take more samples in the frequency domain when calculating the DFT.  Unfortunately, it isn't quite the solution you might hope for.  To obtain more frequency domain samples, the number of points in the DFT needs to be increased, but that means the input sequence must be longer.  If you have no more data to use, then all that can be done is to append zeros to the input (zero padding), and then use the longer DFT.  As you will see below, it does result in more frequency domain samples, and the shape of the window is more evident, however it doesn't reduce the amount of leakage.  One thing that it does give, though, is a more accurate indication of the frequency of the input as the peak of the transform is more easily seen."
