    "# Demonstration of Autocorrelation for an Ensemble \n",
    "The standard definition of autocorrelation uses the joint probability density function to determine the correlation at a specific delay.  In a practical scenario, we have an ensemble of realisations.  While the relationship at a given delay may not be obvious for all realisations, once averaging of the relationships is carried out, the correlation can be observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this animated demonstration, random signals are generated by driving a bandpass filter with white noise.  For each noise signal, the ouptut will be different.  We will examine the relationship between two points in time, and plot their values on a scatterplot.  Sample points that are correlated will be observed as a linear relationship between the samples.  If, however, they are not correlated, no relationship will be evident.\n",
