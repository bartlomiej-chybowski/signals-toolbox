    "# LTI Estimation\n",
    "There are many situations where it would be beneficial to be able to measure the impulse response of a linear time invariant (LTI) system.  It is not always a good idea to input an impluse as this can cause the system to behave in an undesired way, possibly moving into regions of operation that are not linear.  An alternative is to drive the system with a noise-like input, and use correlation to be able to measure the impulse response."

An LTI system is one whose impulse response does not change (the system is time invariant), and that the output can be related to the input through a convolution operation (linear).  So, this function defines the impulse response as an FIR filter, and then uses lfilter from scipy to generate the output of the system for the specified input.
