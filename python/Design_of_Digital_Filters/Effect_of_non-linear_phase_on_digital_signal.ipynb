    "# The importance of linear phase when filtering\n",
    "In certain situations, for example digital communications, it is important that all filters that are designed have linear phase.  In this notebook we design a filter that does not attenuate any frequency, but instead alters only the phase of the input in a non-linear fashion.  As a result of this process, the signal no longer has an obvious digital structure."
