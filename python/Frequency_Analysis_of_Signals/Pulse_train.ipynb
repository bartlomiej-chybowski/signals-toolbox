    "### Introduction\n",
    "To obtain the frequency transform of a periodic continuous time signal, the Fourier Series is used.  This results in a frequency domain that is sampled.  For a periodic signal that is sampled in the time domain (discrete), then there is an equivalen transform called the Discrete-time Fourier Series (DTFS).  As the signal is periodic in the time domain, then it is sampled in the frequency domain, but also as it is sampled in the time domain, it is periodic in the frequency domain.\n",
